# 🌐 First Webpage – HTML & CSS

This is my **first webpage built using HTML and CSS**.  
I’m very excited to share this project because I actually built it myself and learned a lot through hands-on practice.

## 📌 About the project

This project is a simple static webpage created to practice the fundamentals of web development.  
The main focus was on understanding **layout, structure, and styling**, rather than making something very fancy.

---

## 🧠 What I learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about:

- Writing **semantic HTML**
- CSS **layout and spacing**
- **Flexbox and positioning** (this part finally started making sense)
- Basic **responsiveness** and how layouts behave on different screen sizes

This project helped me understand how web layouts actually work instead of just watching tutorials.

## ⚠️ Limitations & improvements

There is still a lot to improve, especially:
- Design choices
- Color balance
- Cleaner spacing and alignment

But that’s part of the learning process, and this project gave me a strong foundation to build on.

I’m sharing it to track my progress and keep improving with every new project.
